# Puzzle Game Development Rules

## Project Overview
Pathwayz - Path-finding puzzle game (LinkedIn Zip inspired) - React + TypeScript + Supabase + TailwindCSS

## Success Strategy: Prototype-First Development
Always build the simplest working version first, then enhance incrementally.
Deploy and test on mobile device after every significant change.

## Before Starting Work
1. Read `CURRENT_STATE.md` for project status
2. Read `TASK_CONTEXT.md` for current session goals
3. Read `GAME_RULES_SPECIFICATION.md` for complete validated game mechanics
4. Focus on ONE deliverable at a time
5. If stuck >30 minutes, implement simpler version first

## Code Standards
- **TypeScript strict mode** - no `any` types
- **React functional components** only
- **TailwindCSS utility classes** only
- **Mobile-first responsive** design
- **60fps animations** for path drawing
- **Comprehensive testing** for game logic

## Game Rules - VALIDATED IN PHASE 0 ✅
- Start at number 1, visit numbers sequentially (1→2→3→...→6)
- Hold-to-draw: path clears when finger/mouse lifts
- Backtracking: sequential only along existing path
- Win condition: ALL numbers (6/6) AND ALL cells covered
- Adjacent moves only (no diagonal)
- Touch targets minimum 44px for mobile
- Must verify puzzle solvability before implementation

## Critical Game Logic (DO NOT CHANGE)
- Movement stops after reaching final number (6)
- Win requires BOTH all numbers AND all cells (strict)
- Backtracking decrements current number when crossing numbered cells
- Enhanced touch detection for mobile responsiveness
- No partial wins (35/36 cells is NOT a win)
- Game freezes on win - no reset when lifting finger/mouse
- Post-win UI changes: hide hint, show new game button

## Making Code Changes - MANDATORY STEPS

When making code changes, NEVER output code to the USER, unless requested. Instead use one of the code edit tools to implement the change.

**For ANY Game Logic Changes (REQUIRED):**
1. Make the code change
2. **IMMEDIATELY update GAME_RULES_SPECIFICATION.md** 
3. Update .cursorrules "Critical Game Logic" section if needed
4. Commit both code AND documentation changes together
5. Note the change in commit message

**Game Logic includes:**
- Movement rules, win conditions, input handling
- UI behavior, state management, event responses  
- Touch interactions, backtracking, path drawing
- Post-win behavior, reset mechanics, validation

**Documentation Update Process:**
- Add new mechanics to appropriate sections
- Update "Phase 0 Validation Results" if tested
- Modify "Critical Functions" if new functions added
- Update "Event Handling" if event behavior changes

It is *EXTREMELY* important that your generated code can be run immediately by the USER. To ensure this, follow these instructions carefully:

## File Structure
```
src/
├── core/          # Pure game logic
├── components/    # UI components
├── hooks/         # Custom hooks
├── utils/         # Utilities
├── types/         # TypeScript types
└── services/      # Supabase integration
```

## Key Performance Requirements
- Page load < 2 seconds
- Smooth path drawing on mobile
- Bundle size < 1MB
- Test coverage > 80% for core logic

## Quality Gates
Run `npm run dev && npm run test && npm run build` before finishing work.

**Before Completing ANY Task with Game Logic Changes:**
- [ ] Code change implemented and tested
- [ ] GAME_RULES_SPECIFICATION.md updated with new/changed mechanics
- [ ] .cursorrules updated if critical game logic changed
- [ ] Both code and documentation committed together
- [ ] Commit message describes both code and documentation changes

**Documentation Check Questions:**
- Does this change how the user interacts with the game?
- Does this change win/lose conditions or game state?
- Does this change touch/mouse behavior or event handling?
- Does this add/remove/modify core game mechanics?

If YES to any → MUST update GAME_RULES_SPECIFICATION.md

**Never finish a session without updating documentation for game logic changes.**

## AI Success Patterns
- If stuck on complex algorithm >30 minutes, implement simple version first
- Always test on mobile device/emulator before marking task complete
- Use React DevTools to verify no performance issues
- If touch events aren't smooth, try different event handling approach
- Prioritize working code over perfect code - optimize later
- Deploy to preview environment after each session

## Complexity Escape Hatches
- Puzzle generation: Use preset puzzles if algorithm is complex
- Path validation: Start with basic validation, enhance incrementally
- Animations: CSS transitions before complex animations
- State management: useState before useReducer for simple cases

## What NOT to Do
- Don't skip TypeScript errors
- Don't use localStorage (use Supabase)
- Don't ignore mobile experience
- Don't trust client-side validation for competitive features

Focus on working code over perfect documentation.
