# Pathwayz - Current Session Task

## Goal
Create a single-file HTML prototype to validate core path-drawing mechanics and mobile touch interactions.

## Tasks
1. [ ] Create `prototype.html` with 6x6 grid and hardcoded puzzle
2. [ ] Implement touch and mouse path drawing
3. [ ] Add basic game rules validation
4. [ ] Test win condition detection
5. [ ] Deploy to GitHub Pages for mobile testing

## Files to Create/Modify
- `prototype.html` - Complete single-file game prototype

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Path drawing works smoothly on mobile device
- [ ] Can complete puzzle from number 1 to 6
- [ ] Touch targets are finger-friendly (44px minimum)
- [ ] No console errors or performance issues
- [ ] Deployed and accessible via URL

## Key Requirements
- Mobile-first responsive design
- 60fps touch interactions
- Adjacent-only movement validation
- Sequential number visiting (1→2→3→4→5→6)
- Visual feedback for path drawing

## Gotchas
- Prevent page scrolling during touch events
- Handle both touch and mouse events
- Ensure smooth animations on mobile devices
- Keep complexity low - this is proof of concept only
