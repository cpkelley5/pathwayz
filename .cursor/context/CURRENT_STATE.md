# Current Project State

## Phase Progress
- [x] **Phase 0:** Proof of Concept (2-hour HTML prototype) ✅ COMPLETE
- [ ] **Phase A:** Foundation Setup (React + TypeScript + Tailwind)
- [ ] **Phase B:** Core Game Logic (puzzle generation + validation)
- [ ] **Phase C:** UI Components (grid, path drawing, controls)
- [ ] **Phase D:** Game Integration (connect UI to logic)
- [ ] **Phase E:** Supabase Integration (auth + database)
- [ ] **Phase F:** Polish & Deploy (leaderboards + social features)

## Current Status
**Active Phase:** Phase A (Foundation Setup)  
**Last Updated:** Phase 0 completed with working HTML prototype

## What's Working ✅
- HTML prototype with complete game functionality
- 6x6 grid with hardcoded puzzle from specification
- Touch and mouse path drawing with smooth animations
- Sequential number visiting validation (1→2→3→4→5→6)
- Adjacent-only movement rules enforced
- Win condition detection and celebration
- Mobile-optimized UI with 44px+ touch targets
- Prevents page scrolling during touch interactions
- Reset and hint functionality working
- Local server running on port 8000

## Current Blockers ❌
- Need to set up GitHub repository for deployment
- Need to test on actual mobile device (currently only desktop tested)

## Next 3 Tasks
1. Set up GitHub repository and deploy prototype for mobile testing
2. Test prototype on mobile device to validate touch interactions
3. Begin Phase A: Set up React + TypeScript + Tailwind foundation

## Quick Notes
- Prototype validates core concept successfully
- Touch events implemented with proper mobile optimizations
- All Phase 0 success criteria met in single HTML file
- Ready to move to React implementation in Phase A
- Game mechanics feel responsive and intuitive

## Success Indicators
- [x] Latest code deploys without errors
- [x] Core game works on desktop browser
- [ ] Touch interactions tested on mobile device
- [x] No console errors in browser
- [x] User can complete puzzle successfully
- [x] Game feels responsive and fun to play
