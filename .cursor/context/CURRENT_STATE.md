# Current Project State

## Phase Progress
- [x] **Phase 0:** Proof of Concept (HTML prototype) ✅ COMPLETE & VALIDATED
- [ ] **Phase A:** Foundation Setup (React + TypeScript + Tailwind)
- [ ] **Phase B:** Core Game Logic (puzzle generation + validation)
- [ ] **Phase C:** UI Components (grid, path drawing, controls)
- [ ] **Phase D:** Game Integration (connect UI to logic)
- [ ] **Phase E:** Supabase Integration (auth + database)
- [ ] **Phase F:** Polish & Deploy (leaderboards + social features)

## Current Status
**Active Phase:** Ready for Phase A (Foundation Setup)  
**Last Updated:** Phase 0 completed with full game rules validation

## What's Working ✅
- Complete HTML prototype with ALL core mechanics validated
- Hold-to-draw behavior (path clears on finger/mouse lift)
- Sequential number visiting with strict validation (1→2→3→4→5→6)
- Backtracking along existing path with number decrement
- Strict win condition (ALL numbers + ALL cells required)
- Movement stops after final number reached
- Enhanced mobile touch sensitivity (forward and backward)
- Puzzle solvability verification algorithm
- 60fps animations with no performance issues
- Mobile-optimized UI with proper touch targets
- Version tracking system (v0.4.0)

## Current Blockers ❌
- None - Phase 0 fully complete and validated

## Next 3 Tasks
1. Initialize React + TypeScript + Tailwind project structure
2. Set up component architecture based on validated game rules
3. Implement core game logic components following GAME_RULES_SPECIFICATION.md

## Quick Notes
- ALL game mechanics thoroughly tested and documented
- Game rules specification created for future phases
- Mobile UX validated and working smoothly
- Puzzle solvability algorithm proven effective
- Ready for confident React implementation

## Success Indicators
- [x] Latest code deploys without errors
- [x] Core game works on desktop browser
- [ ] Touch interactions tested on mobile device
- [x] No console errors in browser
- [x] User can complete puzzle successfully
- [x] Game feels responsive and fun to play
