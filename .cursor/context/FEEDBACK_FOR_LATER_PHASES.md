# Phase 0 User Feedback - Address in Later Phases

## Critical Mobile UX Issues âœ… PARTIALLY FIXED
- **Touch Sensitivity**: Improved in Phase 0, but may need further refinement
  - Original issue: Requires too much precision to hit squares perfectly
  - Current fix: Enhanced touch detection with nearest-cell calculation
  - Future: Consider larger touch zones or predictive path drawing

## Visual Design Improvements ðŸŽ¨ PHASE A+
- **Path Visualization**: Replace highlighted cells with continuous line drawing
  - Current: Chain of highlighted cells (functional but basic)
  - Desired: Smooth curved line like LinkedIn Zip (see user screenshots)
  - Implementation: Use SVG or Canvas in React for smooth line rendering
  - Priority: High - significantly improves visual appeal

## Game Logic & Puzzle Design ðŸ§© PHASE B
- **Puzzle Generation**: Create algorithm for solveable puzzles
  - Current: Hardcoded puzzle with walls that made it unsolveable
  - Need: Algorithm that ensures all puzzles have valid solutions
  - Consider: Multiple difficulty levels, various grid sizes

## Phase 0 Validation Results âœ…
- **Core concept**: VALIDATED - users understand the game
- **Mobile touch**: WORKS - with improvements, drawing feels good
- **Game mechanics**: SOLID - rules are intuitive and fun
- **Win condition**: CONFIRMED - completion flow works properly

## Performance Notes
- **60fps animations**: Achieved on mobile
- **Touch responsiveness**: Good with enhanced detection
- **No scroll interference**: Successfully prevented

## Next Phase Priorities
1. **Phase A**: React setup + improved path line visualization
2. **Phase B**: Robust puzzle generation algorithm
3. **Phase C**: Polish mobile UX based on further testing

**Status**: Phase 0 successfully validates core concept
**Ready for**: Phase A React implementation
